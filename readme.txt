Scripturizer will convert Bible references in your posts and comments into hyperlinks to online Bibles.

== Description ==

Scripturizer will convert Bible references in your posts and comments into hyperlinks to online Bibles.

For example, it will change John 3:16 into something like
<a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ROM+6:23&version=46;">John 3:16</a>

Online Bibles currently supported are:

* <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/">Bible Gateway</a>
* <a href="http://www.bible.org/">The NET Bible</a>
* <a href="http://www.gnpcb.org/esv/">The English Standard Version</a>
* <a href="http://bible.oremus.org/" title="the New Revised Standard Version">Oremus Bible Browser</a>
* <a href="http://www.zhubert.com">Septuagint Greek OT / Nestle-Aland 26th ed. Greek NT</a>

You can customize the plugin to use your favorite Bible translation or to include links useful for users
of Logos Bible Software by editing scripturizer.php and adjusting the configuration parameters near the
top of the file.

== Installation ==

Basic:

 - From the Wordpress Dashboard: Manage / Plugins
3. View the Plugin Options page to change the default translation (initially NIV) and other basic options:
 - Default translation:
     - Translation to which scripturizer defaults if no translation is detected in the Scripture reference
 - Dynamic substitution
     - Controls whether scripturizer adds links:
         - Each time a post is viewed (dynamic)
         - At the time a post is created or edited (static, permanently edits post)
     - Note that Dynamic Substitution allows for changes in default translation as well as changes in linked website interfaces
 - Libronix Support
     - Determines whether or not scripturizer adds Libronix Links

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How Scripturizer Recognizes Scripture References =

1. Scripturizer will recognize Scripture references that conform to somewhat loose conventions:
 - [Book] [Chapter]
 - [Book] [Chapter]:[Verse]
 - [Book] [Chapter]:[Verse]-[verse]
2. Where [Book] can be a full name or an abbreviation, with prefix as applicable. Note that prefixes can be in several formats:
 - 1, 2, 3
 - I, II, II
 - First, Second, Third
 - 1st, 2nd, 3rd
3. Scripturizer will recognize most common book abbreviations.
 - NOTE: All abbreviated references to Judges should include the letter 'g' in order to differentiate between Judges and Jude.
4. Scripturizer can also recognize translation acronyms following Scripture references:
 - [Reference] [Translation]
 - [Reference] ([Translation])
